Enter here any changes you make

V0.02

I found an error on mapSaver.py, until you fix the durability im not making any changes you might undo.
I've upgraded the UI to more intuitive controls.
All map "handlers" have comments which indicate what each file and section of code does.
The saver and loader might not work though :D
